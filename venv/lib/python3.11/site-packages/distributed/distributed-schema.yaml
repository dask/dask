              The number of retries before a task is considered bad

              When a worker dies when a task is running that task is rerun elsewhere.
              If many workers die while running this same task then we call the task bad, and raise a KilledWorker exception.
              This is the number of workers that are allowed to die before this task is marked as bad.

              The expected bandwidth between any pair of workers

              This is used when making scheduling decisions.
              The scheduler will use this value as a baseline, but also learn it over time.

              A list of handlers to exclude

              The scheduler operates by receiving messages from various workers and clients
              and then performing operations based on those messages.
              Each message has an operation like "close-worker" or "task-finished".
              In some high security situations administrators may choose to block certain handlers
              from running.  Those handlers can be listed here.

              For a list of handlers see the `dask.distributed.Scheduler.handlers` attribute.

              Comm object for each worker. Set this to False if you want to close the Comm after each broadcast.

              any available worker or no workers are running at all.

              In adaptive clusters, this timeout must be set to be safely higher than

              # infinity from a DASK_* environment variable.
              - enum: [inf]
            description: |
              Controls how many root tasks are sent to workers (like a `readahead`).

              Up to worker-saturation * nthreads root tasks are sent to a
              worker at a time. If `.inf`, all runnable tasks are immediately sent to workers.
              The target number is rounded up, so any `worker-saturation` value > 1.0 guarantees
              at least one extra task will be sent to workers.

              Allowing oversaturation (> 1.0) means a worker may start running a new root task as
              soon as it completes the previous, even if there is a higher-priority downstream task
              to run. This reduces worker idleness, by letting workers do something while waiting for
              further instructions from the scheduler, even if it's not the most efficient
              thing to do.

              This generally comes  at the expense of increased memory usage. It leads to "wider"
              (more breadth-first) execution of the graph.

              Compute-bound workloads may benefit from oversaturation. Memory-bound workloads should
              generally leave `worker-saturation` at 1.0, though 1.25-1.5 could slightly improve
              performance if ample memory is available.

              worker saturation is set.
            
              A task group is identifier as rootish if it has only up to a certain number
              of dependencies (5 by default). This can be faulty for very large datasets
              where the number of data tasks from xarray can be higher than 5.
              
              Increasing this limit will capture these root tasks successfully but increase
              the risk of misidentifying task groups as rootish, which can have
              performance implications.

                  If you create many workers at the same time,
                  you may want to avoid having them kill themselves all at the same time.
                  To avoid this you might want to set a stagger time,
                  so that they close themselves with some random variation, like "5 minutes"

                  That way some workers can die, new ones can be brought up,
                  and data can be transferred over smoothly.
