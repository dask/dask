  # codecov pushes a failing status update to github actions before all the
  # test runs have completed (this is later updated to passing after more test
  # runs pass, but the initial red X is annoying). As far as I can tell from
  # https://docs.codecov.com/docs/merging-reports this shouldn't be happening,
  # but it is. Here we set a minimum number of builds before notifying in the
  # hopes that it will stop this behavior.
  # This number is informed by the number of builds defined by the matrix in
  # .github/workflows/tests.yml.
