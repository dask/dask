0.11.0 / 2016-08-24
-------------------

Major Points
++++++++++++

DataFrames now enforce knowing full metadata (columns, dtypes) everywhere.
Previously we would operate in an ambiguous state when functions lost dtype
information (such as ``apply``).  Now all dataframes always know their dtypes
and raise errors asking for information if they are unable to infer (which
they usually can).  Some internal attributes like ``_pd`` and
``_pd_nonempty`` have been moved.

The internals of the distributed scheduler have been refactored to
transition tasks between explicit states.  This improves resilience,
reasoning about scheduling, plugin operation, and logging.  It also makes
the scheduler code easier to understand for newcomers.

Breaking Changes
++++++++++++++++

- The ``distributed.s3`` and ``distributed.hdfs`` namespaces are gone.  Use
  protocols in normal methods like ``read_text('s3://...'`` instead.
- ``Dask.array.reshape`` now errs in some cases where previously it would have
  create a very large number of tasks

0.10.2 / 2016-07-27
-------------------

- More Dataframe shuffles now work in distributed settings, ranging from
  setting-index to hash joins, to sorted joins and groupbys.
- Dask passes the full test suite when run when under in Python's
  optimized-OO mode.
- On-disk shuffles were found to produce wrong results in some
  highly-concurrent situations, especially on Windows.  This has been resolved
  by a fix to the partd library.
- Fixed a growth of open file descriptors that occurred under large data
  communications
- Support ports in the ``--bokeh-whitelist`` option ot dask-scheduler to better
  routing of web interface messages behind non-trivial network settings
- Some improvements to resilience to worker failure (though other known
  failures persist)
- You can now start an IPython kernel on any worker for improved debugging and
  analysis
- Improvements to ``dask.dataframe.read_hdf``, especially when reading from
  multiple files and docs

0.10.0 / 2016-06-13
-------------------

Major Changes
+++++++++++++

- This version drops support for Python 2.6
- Conda packages are built and served from conda-forge
- The ``dask.distributed`` executables have been renamed from dfoo to dask-foo.
  For example dscheduler is renamed to dask-scheduler
- Both Bag and DataFrame include a preliminary distributed shuffle.

Bag
++++

- Add task-based shuffle for distributed groupbys
- Add accumulate for cumulative reductions

DataFrame
+++++++++

- Add a task-based shuffle suitable for distributed joins, groupby-applys, and
  set_index operations.  The single-machine shuffle remains untouched (and
  much more efficient.)
- Add support for new Pandas rolling API with improved communication
  performance on distributed systems.
- Add ``groupby.std/var``
- Pass through S3/HDFS storage options in ``read_csv``
- Improve categorical partitioning
- Add eval, info, isnull, notnull for dataframes

Distributed
+++++++++++

- Rename executables like dscheduler to dask-scheduler
- Improve scheduler performance in the many-fast-tasks case (important for
  shuffling)
- Improve work stealing to be aware of expected function run-times and data
  sizes.  The drastically increases the breadth of algorithms that can be
  efficiently run on the distributed scheduler without significant user
  expertise.
- Support maximum buffer sizes in streaming queues
- Improve Windows support when using the Bokeh diagnostic web interface
- Support compression of very-large-bytestrings in protocol
- Support clean cancellation of submitted futures in Joblib interface

Other
+++++

- All dask-related projects (dask, distributed, s3fs, hdfs, partd) are now
  building conda packages on conda-forge.
- Change credential handling in s3fs to only pass around delegated credentials
  if explicitly given secret/key.  The default now is to rely on managed
  environments.  This can be changed back by explicitly providing a keyword
  argument.  Anonymous mode must be explicitly declared if desired.

0.9.0 / 2016-05-11
------------------

API Changes
+++++++++++

- ``dask.do`` and ``dask.value`` have been renamed to ``dask.delayed``

- All S3/HDFS data ingest functions like ``db.from_s3`` or
  ``distributed.s3.read_csv`` have been moved into the plain ``read_text``,
  ``read_csv functions``, which now support protocols, like
  ``dd.read_csv('s3://bucket/keys*.csv')``

Array
+++++

- Add support for ``scipy.LinearOperator``
- Improve optional locking to on-disk data structures
