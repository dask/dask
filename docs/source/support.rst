Dask is used and developed by individuals at a variety of institutions.  It
sits within the broader Python numeric ecosystem commonly referred to as PyData
or SciPy.

Discussion
----------

Conversation happens in the following places:

1.  **Usage questions** are directed to `Stack Overflow with the #dask tag`_.
    Dask developers monitor this tag and get e-mails whenever a question is
    asked.
2.  **Bug reports and feature requests** are managed on the `GitHub issue
    tracker`_
3.  **Chat** occurs on at `gitter.im/dask/dask <https://gitter.im/dask/dask>`_
    for general conversation and `gitter.im/dask/dev
    <https://gitter.im/dask/dev>`_ for developer conversation.  Note that
    because gitter chat is not searchable by future users we discourage usage
    questions and bug reports on gitter and instead ask people to use Stack
    Overflow or GitHub.
4.  **Weekly developer meeting** usually happens at Thursday 4pm UTC (11am in New
    York, 8am in Los Angeles, 12am in Beijing) at https://appear.in/dask-dev
    with meeting notes on a publicly viewable `document
    <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nh50G7K1xR4lPfo6ynDC7O6L-qUvM0FiXaxKeWelNw8/edit?usp=sharing>`_
    Subscribe to this `public calendar <https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4l0vts0c1cgdbq5jhcogj55sfs%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics>`_
    to receive updates if the meeting is rescheduled or canceled.

Asking for help
---------------

We welcome usage questions and bug reports from all users, even those who are
new to using the project.  There are a few things you can do to improve the
likelihood of quickly getting a good answer.

1.  **Ask questions in the right place**.  In particular we strongly prefer the use
    of StackOverflow and Github issues over Gitter chat.  Github and
    StackOverflow are more easily searchable by future users and so is more
    efficient for everyone's time.  Gitter chat is strictly reserved for
    developer and community discussion.
2.  **Create a minimal example**.  It is ideal to create `minimal, complete,
    verifiable examples <https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve>`_.  This
    significantly reduces the time that answerers spend understanding your
    situation and so results in higher quality answers more quickly.

Paid support
------------

Dask is an open source project that originated at `Anaconda Inc.
<https://www.anaconda.com/>`_.  In addition to the previous options, Anaconda
offers paid training and support:  `<https://www.anaconda.com/support>`_.
